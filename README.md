# Tooltips
Tooltips on images without extra elements, if you have to edit every image to add a tooltip... don't do it, use this. No need to add anything, just the container with images.

## How to use:
Just call the function with the content container ID and the ID of the element you want to display the list.

```html
<article id='article'>
  <!-- Content -->
</article>
```

```html
<div id='tc' class="block">
  <!-- Here goes the table content generated by JS -->
</div>
```

Now you just need to call the function.

```javascript
tc('article','tc', document);
```
